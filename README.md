# IMM 2016 Coming Soon Page

## Getting started
After cloning the repo to your local machine, run: 
`npm install`
This will create a node_modules folder with all of the dependencies. If you get an error, try:
`sudo npm install`

## Running the app
Once you have successfully installed the dependencies, you simply need to run `gulp` to start the app. This will start a local server on port 3000. Once the app is running, you will have access to all of the goodies like livereload, sass (no need to use compass), autoprefixer, and a lot more.
